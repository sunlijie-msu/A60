 60CR c  E=400 MeV. Projectile-like nuclei following multi-nucleon transfers    
 60CR2c  were detected with PRISMA magnetic spectrometer. The gamma rays were   
 60CR3c  measured using CLARA array of 25 EUROBALL Clover Ge detectors.         
 60CR3c  Coincidences were measured between gamma rays and Cr isotopes.
