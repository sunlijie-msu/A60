 60CU c  Bremsstrahlung radiation generated by 900 MeV electrons. Spatial       
 60CU2c  distribution of radionuclides produced in a 15 cm thick copper         
 60CU3c  target was measured and compared to theoretical calculation.           
 60CU4c  Effective cross sections and effective photon energy ranges were       
 60CU5c  derived.
