 60TI c  {+86}Kr beam impinged on 50 mg/cm{+2} thick tantalum target using      
 60TI2c  LISE-2000 spectrometer at GANIL facility. Detector system included a   
 60TI3c  three-element Si-detector telescope containing a double-sided          
 60TI4c  silicon-strip detector (DSSSD) backed by a Si(Li) detector and         
 60TI5c  surrounded by four clover type EXOGAM Ge detectors. Product identified

 60TI6c  spectrograph. Measured E|g, I|g, |g|g-coin, and ({+60}Ti)|g-coin using 
 60TI7c  GRETINA array of 36-folded segmented HPGe detectors arranged in 58|'   
 60TI8c  and 90|' geometry. Gamma-ray energies were deduced from Doppler-
