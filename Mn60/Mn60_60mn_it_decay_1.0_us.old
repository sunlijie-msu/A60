 60MN c  {+60}Mn produced through the {+9}Be({+238}U,X) reaction. {+238}U       
 60MN2c  beam produced at E=8.00 MeV/nucleon by the K500 and K1200              
 60MN3c  cyclotrons at the National Superconducting Laboratory at Michigan      
 60MN4c  State University. Reaction products were separated using the A1900     
 60MN5c  fragment separator and detected using two parallel plate avalanche     
 60MN6c  counters, a Si |DE detector, four Si detectors, and a plastic          
 60MN7c  scintillator. Measurements of the time-of-flight (tof), B|r and total  
 60MN8c  kinetic energy were used to determine the atomic number, mass number   
 60MN9c  and charge state of reaction products. The |g's were detected with one 
 60MNAc  HPGe detector. Half-lives were measured using the time difference      
 60MNBc  between implantation events and HPGe events, which was not suitable    
 60MNCc  for measuring half-lives of less than 500 ns. Measured particle        
 60MNDc  spectra, E|g, I|g, (particle)|g-coincidence and half-lives of          
 60MNEc  isomeric states.                                                       
 60MN c  Isomer with half-life of 1.0 |ms {I+3-2} discovered but with an
